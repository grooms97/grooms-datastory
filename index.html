<h2> The Data Collection </h2>


<div>
  <p>For a total of five days, I tracked my Twitter usage. What was my intention? How was I feeling?
  Where was I? Was this a verified account I was viewing? These are just some of the many questions
  that I wanted answers to. I created a visual, aka DataViz, to help me convey what I learned from
  recording data. I chose to zero in on the factors that told me the most information for my visual.
  These included the device, number of times Twitter was accessed with that device, mood at the time
  of use and account status –meaning verified or not.</p></div>

<div> This is a categorical chart. As the legend shows, I thought it would be interesting to divide information up by device.
I found that there were no major differences regarding the device I accessed Twitter on, but overall, I learned that I
use Twitter the most on my iPhone when I am out and about. I am also an avid viewer of verified accounts. Twitter is essentially
my news source; this is how I stay informed about what’s going on in the world. I tend to view it when I am tired or content.
