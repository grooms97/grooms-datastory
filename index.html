      <li><h2>
        The Data Collection
      </h2>
        <p>I tracked my Twitter usage for 5 days: Monday-Friday. I payed attention to factors including the timestamp,
            my intention, my mood, the device I was using at the time (i.e. IPhone or laptop), my location, the amount of time
            I spent using it, the account handle (i.e. @NBCNews), the account status (i.e. verified), whether or not I was following
            the account, the media (i.e. image, video), the topic and subject, and tweet interaction (i.e. 350 retweets). </p>
        <p> In Figure 1, you will see the data visual that was created from this data. It was created using InkScape.
            I believe that I found out a good amount about my usage habits. For example, it looks as though, the majority of the time,
            I am either tired or content. During these moods, I am viewing (almost) all verified accounts. This could be due to the fact
            that I am seeking out waking up and seeing what I have missed in the news--this would involve verified accounts. I also tend to turn
            to Twitter when I am content, looking for accounts of celebrities to entertain me.</p>

        <p> I also found out quite a bit about the device I use to access Twitter. Evidently, I use my phone to access
            Twitter more than I use my laptop. I believe this is because my phone is always on my person--my laptop is not.
            It's much easier to pull up the Twitter application on my IPhone when I am waiting for class than it is to whip out my laptop.

        The Takeaway
      </h2>
        <p> Overall, this project has convinced me that I should change my habits. After viewing the timestamps,
            I realized that I spend a lot of needless time on Twitter throughout the day. I need to cut back and spend
            more time with the people around me.

        <p>Additionally, I should start viewing more accounts that aren't verified. This would include many of my friends'
          accounts. It would distract me from negative news and I believe that it could uplift my mood.</p>
